        Hello! I'm Your Name, a passionate web developer with a love for clean, functional, and accessible websites. With a background in design and a knack for problem-solving, I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey started with HTML/CSS and quickly expanded into JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more. I’m always learning and looking to grow in both frontend and backend development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy photography, hiking, and playing guitar. I believe that creativity fuels great code and vice versa.
